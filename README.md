_Describing historical data? Why not to use a timeline?_

## Greetings
Hi ✋! My name is Nickolas, known as nickolasrm, the creator of this app.

Today I'm gonna guide you through the
usage of this simple, but elegant app that helps you making timelines.

## What is a timeline?
A timeline is a solution for visualizing historical data in a form similar to the way we
measure length with a ruler.

## What is TimelineBubbles?
TimelineBubbles is a project I developed to reduce the amount of time I spend building
timelines for my presentations. Most of my presentations have a historical background,
and because of that, I wasted lots of time building timelines. I just don't want it to
happen again.

## Should I use this app?
If you're going to make a presentation or just want to create a historical representation,
for sure, use it!

## Usage
Go to the [app page]()

For installing locally (only if you are going to edit the code): 
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. A browser tab will be opened at `localhost:3000`. Enjoy

## Theming
Of course you can theme your timeline. Here below are some examples:
